## Build marketplace docker image

Execute 
```shell
docker build --no-cache -t garagatyi/che-marketplace:os .
```
Where `--no-cache` is needed to prevent usage of cached layers with marketplace files.
Useful when you change marketplace files and rebuild the image.

`-t garagatyi/che-marketplace:os` is needed to set identifier of the image.
Do not forget to change `feature-api.yaml` file accordingly if you change this identifier to something else.

## Use custome repository as a source of marketplace files

To use a custom git repo as a source of marketplace files use next command to build the image:
```shell
docker build --no-cache -t garagatyi/che-marketplace:os --build-arg STORAGE_REPO=https://github.com/someuser/somerepo .
```

## Use local path as a source of marketplace files

To use local path as a source of marketplace files use next command to build the image:
```shell
docker build --no-cache -t garagatyi/che-marketplace:os --build-arg STORAGE_TYPE=path --build-arg STORAGE_PATH=some_path_in_build_context path_to_build_context
```
